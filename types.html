            <h2>Ethical</h2>
            <p>
              Those who have adopted a vegan lifestyle because they are
              adamantly opposed to animal cruelty are known as ethical vegans.
              Such vegans abhor any form of animal exploitation in their daily
              lives. A third of those who decide to become vegans do so out of
              compassion for animals. Animals are intelligent beings with a
              right to life. According to ethical vegans, there is no
              distinction between a dog and a pig or a cat and a fish. They are
              all living things with the need to survive and are conscious.

            <h2>Environmental</h2>
            <p>
              These people adopt a vegan diet as a means to live more
              sustainably and to help the environment. Environmental vegans
              think that by choosing a vegan diet, they  lessen their impact on
              deforestation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize
              pollution by refusing to support animal agriculture. Are you aware
              that greenhouse gas emissions from animal husbandry exceed those
              from all global transportation systems combined?

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>
              A vegan diet may reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular
              disease, according to a research by the medical testing business
              Medichecks. Participants in the study who had switched to veganism
              had blood glucose and harmful cholesterol levels that were below
              average. For health reasons, those with lactose sensitivity may
              also decide to follow a vegan diet.

            <h2>Religious</h2>
            <p>
              Religious vegans choose their dietary choice based on their
              spiritual convictions. For instance, Jainism is a religion whose
              adherents follow a strict vegan diet. It is a tradition from
              ancient India. All forms of violence are abhorred by Jainists.
              Their main conviction is that all religious action is meaningless
              if they do not give up all violent behavior. “One’s ultimate
              religious responsibility is non-violence,” as a result, which
              extends to their eating habits. Though not all Buddhists are
              vegan, there are a few of them. Buddhism has many diverse schools,
              some of which include vegan practitioners. Some Buddhist sects
              advise vegetarianism and restrict monks from consuming any sort of
              meat. In a same vein, 33% of Hindus practice vegetarianism. There
              are a few Jewish vegans and during lent, some Christians also
              adopt a vegan or vegetarian diet.
