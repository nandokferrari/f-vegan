            <h2>Greenhouse gasses</h2>
            <p>
              Animal husbandry produces a significant amount of GHGs. Two of the
              greatest offenders on this front are the cattle and dairy sectors,
              which account for more than half of all GHG emissions from animal
              agriculture as a whole. With 44% of the total, methane is the GHG
              that is released the most frequently. Carbon dioxide and nitrous
              oxide make up approximately equally the remaining 56%.Cattle make
              about 65 percent of the contributions made by animal agriculture,
              including cattle raised for manure, as working animals, as well as
              cattle bred for dairy and meat. To further break this down, the
              industry as a whole emits around 20% of its GHG emissions from the
              production of dairy products and about 41% from the production of
              beef. These are then followed by pig meat, which is responsible
              for about 9% of emissions, buffalo milk and meat, which together
              account for 8%, chicken meat and eggs, which together account for
              another 8%, and finally, small ruminant milk and meat (such as
              sheep and goats’ milk and meat), which is responsible for 6% of
              the industry’s GHG emissions. Other birds raised for food, such as
              geese and ducks, and non-edible goods make up the remaining
              portion.

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <p>
              The animal agriculture business still occupies a substantial
              amount of land for grazing cattle, cultivating feed for the
              animals, and storing waste, despite the prevalence of factory
              farms that cram thousands of animals into a limited amount of
              area. Large areas of land are needed for these operations, which
              frequently result in deforestation and environmental degradation
              and severe environmental catastrophe. Whether for raising farmed
              animals or cultivating their feed, animal agriculture uses up more
              than 80% of cropland. One of the factors causing deforestation is
              the desire for such a vast amount of land. According to estimates,
              one to two acres of land are removed per second. Animal
              agribusiness is thought to be to blame for up to 90% of the
              degradation now occurring in the Amazon rainforest, while it
              accounts for up to 80% globally. Land deterioration is also
              facilitated by animal agriculture. For instance, cattle bred for
              meat on public lands in the western United States graze on all the
              natural and indigenous grasses, harming native species and
              accelerating desertification. Large tracts of unsuitable desert
              land are created by the extensive livestock grazing, which causes
              the soil to become depleted of nutrients and water. Due to the
              severe stress it is put under, the cropland that is used to grow
              the corn and other commodities fed to farmed animals—particularly
              to cattle meant for meat during their last few months of life—also
              suffers. Monoculture, an intense agricultural technique in which
              one crop is cultivated year after year, requires the clearing and
              usage of large areas of land. The time and energy required by the
              soil to maintain its structure and nutrients are not provided by
              this type of crop development. Large quantities of fertilizers and
              pesticides are frequently sprayed to the fields to maintain high
              agricultural yields, further degrading the environment and hurting
              local species. 3. Protecting the RainforestEvery second, an area
              of rainforest equivalent to a football field is cleared to rear
              and graze animals for the meat and dairy industries.

            <h2>Polution</h2>
            <p>
              Thousands of animals reside on factory farms, and each one
              urinates and feces daily. Due to inadequate living circumstances,
              illness, or accident, many of the animals will pass away before
              being brought to be slaughtered. There are probably a number of
              enormous holes where their remains, together with whatever garbage
              they may have produced, will be kept. These pits’ hazardous
              contents may seep into the groundwater or may be discharged during
              a flood, washing onto the yards or even the homes of neighboring
              homeowners. In addition to the risk posed by these cesspits, the
              towns where these farms are located also have to contend with the
              obnoxious noise and foul stench caused by thousands of animals
              being lined up to die. Due to the urgent demand for animal feed,
              which is generated for livestock, heavy dosages of fertilizers,
              antibiotics, and pesticides are frequently dumped into the
              environment. Dead zones, or parts of the local ecosystem that are
              utterly devoid of life, are produced by this surplus trash. There
              are presently 405 dead zones documented in the world, and decades
              of agricultural pollution have rendered more than half of
              America’s rivers and streams lifeless. Thankfully, research
              indicates that dead zones may be eliminated or much reduced if
              animal husbandry businesses clean up after themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>Water</h2>
            <p>
              Animal husbandry uses one-third of all drinking water despite the
              fact that millions of people lack access to safe drinking water.
              It is astounding how much water is needed to consume just one
              serving of an animal product. A pound of beef may need up to 1800
              gallons of water during manufacturing, compared to just 53 gallons
              needed to create one egg. Popular plant-based protein source soy
              uses 71% less water than chicken does to create a pound of soy.
              The majority of the fresh water used in agriculture—largely for
              animal agriculture—occurs worldwide. In contrast, pulses have a
              two to six times smaller water impact than animal products.
              Although this figure does not include the irrigation and other
              water needs required to grow crops for animal feed, the livestock
              industry in the United States uses around 2 billion gallons of
              water every day. Every day, the aquaculture industry uses around
              7.6 billion gallons. There are currently 405 identified dead zones
              around the world, and more than half of America’s rivers and
              streams are now unable to support life after decades of
              agricultural pollution. While some people believe that eating wild
              fish is more “natural” than eating fish from intense fisheries,
              the 300,000 whales, dolphins, and porpoises who are killed each
              year as a result of getting trapped in fishing nets are anything
              but natural. Thousands of turtles, seals, and birds also perish
              from wounds brought on by nets and tackle, and even while
              technology is progressing to prevent this “by-catch,” the industry
              is still doing a great deal of harm to an ecosystem that is
              already vulnerable.

            <h2>Wildlife and biodiversity</h2>
            <p>
              According to a Chatham House analysis, species of bacteria,
              fungus, plants, and animals are disappearing at a faster rate than
              they have in the previous 10 million years. The conversion of
              lands once used for natural ecosystems into intensive,
              industrial-style agricultural is the primary cause of this
              biodiversity loss. Over 75 million hectares (approximately 1.5
              times the size of Spain) of the Amazon rainforest were removed
              between 1978 and 2020 to create room for cattle rearing. The
              primary cause of biodiversity loss is a global food system that
              places a premium on inexpensive food and uses intensive
              agricultural practices that harm “soils and ecosystems.”
